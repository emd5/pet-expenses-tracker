### What was surprising or interesting about reviewing your partnerâ€™s codebase?
- Implementing google maps with spring and javascript was similar to how i implemented the chart on my project.
- Xia showed me a different way to search in the database by adding methods into the crud repo interface.

### What was surprising or interesting about reviewing your own codebase?
-Needed to java doc, document code.
-In the header.html, make a div and add a th:if condition for when the user can view the nav as a logged in user or 
not a logged in user.

### What would you do differently next time?
- Use the CRUD repository to query things instead of writing helper methods to gather expenses. 
- Create a dashboard controller separately instead of putting it in the home controller.
